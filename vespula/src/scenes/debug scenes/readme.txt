bees are colorblind to the color red and cannot see it

pheremones will only prohibit the kinds of actions a bee can take when detected with certain types taking priority over others
this will be implemented with continue if statements


ex.

for (each bee){
    if (pheremone is nearby){
        // do whatever is caused by the pheremone

        find flowers or something

        continue
        //continue so behavior doesn't get overwritten by conditions down the line


    }
}
